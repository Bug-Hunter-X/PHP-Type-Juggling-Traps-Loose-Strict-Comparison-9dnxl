In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error is the misuse of the `==` (loose comparison) operator instead of the `===` (strict comparison) operator, especially when dealing with type juggling.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-track bugs.

For example:

```php
$a = 0;
$b = "0";

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Loose comparison: Values are equal";
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strict comparison: Values are equal";
}
```

The loose comparison (`==`) will output "Loose comparison: Values are equal" because PHP converts the string "0" to an integer 0 before comparing.  The strict comparison (`===`), however, will not output anything because it checks for both value and type equality, and the types differ.
