The solution is to always use strict comparison (`===`) when comparing values in PHP, unless you explicitly intend to allow type coercion.  This ensures that both the value and the data type match.

```php
$a = 0;
$b = "0";

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strict comparison: Values are equal"; //This will not execute
}
else{
  echo "Strict comparison: Values are not equal";
}
```

By using `===`, you avoid the unexpected behavior caused by PHP's type juggling and improve the reliability of your code.
